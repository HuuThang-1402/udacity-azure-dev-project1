### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

#### Cost

The App Service will have lower cost than VM when we use to deploy the CMS app, because the virtual machine is continuously operating and using resources like CPU and memory even when the program is not in use.

#### Scalability

There are scaling limitations with Azure App Service. About this field maybe Azure VMs is better than Azure App Service.

#### Availability

Both of VM and App Service have high availability.


#### My choice for this CMS App

Because we can easily and quickly deploy this program on Azure App Service, also the code in this program not need to be flexible or changeable. So, I think the best option for this program is App Service.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.*

Virtual Machines: For applications that require more flexibility and changeability or high processor as image, video processing, virtual machines are considerably superior.
